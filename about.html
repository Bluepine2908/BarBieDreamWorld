                Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, 
                manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. 
                The toy was based on the German Bild Lilli doll which Handler had purchased while in Europe. 
                The figurehead of an eponymous brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories, 
                Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. 
                Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and 
                most profitable line.
                The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since 1984, 
                including video games, animated films, television/web series, and a live-action film.
                Barbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world.
                Mattel generates a large portion of Barbie's revenue through related merchandise â€”accessories, clothes, 
                friends, and relatives of Barbie. 
                Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant
                impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, 
                and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with 
                affluent friends.
